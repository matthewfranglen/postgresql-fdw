##  Limitations

The way that data is stored

And the way it is manipulated

Limit how fast certain queries can run

Different arrangements have different performance

Note:

No one way is best

##  The Right Tool

No one structure for data is optimal for all use cases

Specific tools can better serve specific needs

 * Full Text Search

 * Message Distribution

 * Horizontal Scaling

Note:

There are many more aspects which are affected by this choice

##  Joining Different Databases

If you view the Application as the data controller

And the different databases as the data sources

Then it is natural to join different data sources in the Application

Note:

A dumb bucket for bits

##  Relations

Data is still relational

Relational Databases are good at Relations

Postgres should mediate the other databases
